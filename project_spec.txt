Fish Cart - Project Overview
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
Project Title: Fish Cart: Hyperlocal Seafood Delivery System Tech Stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) Type: Hyperlocal E-Commerce / On-Demand Logistics

2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
Wastage: Local vendors buy stock blindly, often leading to spoilage and financial loss if fish remains unsold.

Inconvenience: Customers must wake up early and visit crowded wet markets to get fresh catch.

Processing Hassle: Cleaning and cutting fish at home is messy and difficult for many households.

Uncertainty: Customers never know what fish is available until they physically reach the market.

3. PROPOSED SOLUTION
Daily Fresh Inventory: A system where the Admin uploads stock only after procuring it, ensuring 100% availability.

Scheduled Ordering: Customers place orders during a designated time period (e.g., evening to morning).

Custom Preparation: Users can choose "Cleaned & Cut" or "Whole" directly on the website.

Logistics Management: A dedicated view for Delivery Partners to manage routes efficiently.

Shop Open: Admin toggles the shop to "Open."

Ordering: Customer logs in at 7:00 PM, selects "Sardine (Cleaned & Cut)," and places an order.

Processing: At 6:00 AM, Admin generates the "Packing List" and hands it to the cleaning staff.

Assignment: Admin marks the order as "Packed" and assigns it to a Delivery Partner.

Delivery: Partner sees the address on their phone, delivers the fish, and marks it "Delivered."
